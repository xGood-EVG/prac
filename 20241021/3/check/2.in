In a bright, sunny park, children love to play. Every day, they come to the park to laugh and play with their friends. There are swings and slides, and everyone enjoys the fresh air. They run around, feeling the warm sun on their faces. Every child has a smile, a smile that lights up the day. When the sun sets, they head home, happy and tired, dreaming of another day in the park.
